# Import the Numpy library
import numpy as np

# Import 'tree' from scikit-learn library
from sklearn import tree

# Print the train data to see the available features
print(train)

# Create the target and features numpy arrays: target, features_one
target = train["Survived"].values
features_one = train[["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare"]].values

# Fit your first decision tree: my_tree_one
my_tree_one = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
my_tree_one = my_tree_one.fit(features_one, target)

# Look at the importance and score of the included features
print(my_tree_one.feature_importances_)

# Impute the missing value with the median
test.Fare[152] = test.Fare.median()

# Extract the features from the test set: Pclass, Sex, Age, and Fare.
test_features = test[['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Fare']].values

# Make your prediction using the test set
my_prediction = my_tree_one.predict(test_features)

# Create a data frame with two columns: PassengerId & Survived. Survived contains your predictions

# Write your solution to a csv file with the name my_solution.csv

# Create a new array with the added features: features_two
features_two = train[["Pclass","Age","Sex","Fare", "SibSp", "Parch", "Embarked"]].values

#Control overfitting by setting "max_depth" to 10 and "min_samples_split" to 5 : my_tree_two
